description: Command-style entry point for regenerating Namba scaffold assets from config.
---

State effect: mutating workflow entry point. Use help/probe paths read-only, and otherwise expect repository state or GitHub state to change.

Generated instruction contract for this command skill:
- Purpose: keep the role or command scope explicit, bounded, and testable.
- Boundary: honor read-only versus mutating state effects, configured sandbox mode, and assigned file or workflow ownership.
- Required output: report concrete actions, changed paths or artifacts, validation evidence, and pass/fail status or blockers.
- Pass/fail criteria: claim success only when acceptance criteria and configured validation are satisfied; otherwise name the exact blocker and impact.
- Evidence expectations: cite source artifacts such as SPEC files, `.namba/` configs, diffs, test output, PR/check links, or generated manifests instead of relying on unsupported assertions.
- Security responsibilities: never expose or commit secrets; treat auth, privacy, destructive commands, permission changes, and external network or credential use as security-sensitive.
- Destructive command and escalation policy: do not run destructive commands unless explicitly requested; request approval for privileged, networked, or sandbox-blocked actions only when the active approval mode allows it, and otherwise report the blocker or use a safe non-escalating path.
- Fallback implementer boundary: if a specialist path is unavailable and the main/default implementer takes over, stay within the assigned scope and preserve the same evidence and validation duties.
- Portability: keep durable guidance non-project-specific unless the current repository config or SPEC explicitly provides the project detail.

Use this skill when the user explicitly says `$namba-regen`, `namba regen`, or asks to re-render generated Namba assets from configuration.

Behavior:
- Regenerate `AGENTS.md`, repo skills under `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, readable `.md` role cards, `.namba/codex/*`, and `.codex/config.toml` from `.namba/config/sections/*.yaml`.
- Do not recreate `.codex/skills/`; that mirror causes duplicate skill discovery in Codex.
- Remove obsolete generated skill files when the template set changes.
